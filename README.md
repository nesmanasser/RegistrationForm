I use Selenium WebDriver with Java as the programming language and TestNG as the framework.
You can run the task using the testng.xml file. 
Screenshots related to failures will be captured when invalid data is entered, 
for example, when spaces are entered in the first name field.
And the report is generated automatically when the TestNG.xml file is executed.
